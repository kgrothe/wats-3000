### *Acquainted with the Night*

I have been one acquainted with the night.<br>
I have walked out in rainâ€”and back in rain.<br>
I have outwalked the furthest city light.

I have looked down the saddest city lane.<br>
I have passed by the watchman on his beat<br>
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.

I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet<br>
When far away an interrupted cry<br>
Came over houses from another street,

But not to call me back or say good-bye;<br>
And further still at an unearthly height,<br>
One luminary clock against the sky

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right. <br>
I have been one acquainted with the night.
