## *Acquainted with the Night*
>_by Robert Frost_

I have been one acquainted with the night.<br>
I have walked out in rainâ€”and back in rain.<br>
I have outwalked the furthest city light.<br>

I have looked down the saddest city lane.<br>
I have passed by the watchman on his beat<br>
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.<br>

I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet<br>
When far away an interrupted cry<br>
Came over houses from another street,<br>

But not to call me back or say good-bye;<br>
And further still at an unearthly height,<br>
One luminary clock against the sky<br>

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.<br>
I have been one acquainted with the night.<br><br>
